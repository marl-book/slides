# Slides for the book "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Foundations and Modern Approaches"

This repository contains slides for the book "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Foundations and Modern Approaches" by Stefano V. Albrecht, Filippos Christianos, and Lukas Sch√§fer.

The book can be freely accessed under this webpage: www.marl-book.com

The slides are written in LaTeX with `beamer` (for a quick introduction to beamer, see this [Overleaf Beamer quickstart guide](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Beamer) and this [five-part tutorial](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Beamer_Presentations%3A_A_Tutorial_for_Beginners_(Part_1)%E2%80%94Getting_Started)). We provide all compiled `.pdf` files for the slides, as well as the source files of all assets and `.tex` files in `/source`. We recommend compiling with `xelatex`.

The slides use the `metropolis` theme, which is a modern, simple and clean theme for LaTeX beamer. The theme can be found on [Github](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/metropolis-beamer-theme/qzyvdhrntfmr). Note: for best results, the `Fira Sans` font should be installed on your system. See the [metropolis theme documentation](https://github.com/matze/mtheme?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for more details.
